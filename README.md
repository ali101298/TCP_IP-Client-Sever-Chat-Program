# TCP/IP Client-Server Chat Program

In this project, I build a Multiple Client/Server Chat program using TCP protocol, socket 
programming, and Multithreading, that implements client-server communication. The program supports multiple chat rooms for multiple clients. This application is developed using Python 
programming and its necessary libraries.

# How to run the program

_Note: To run the program, first, you will need to ensure that your computer has python installed. If not you can do it using the link here https://www.python.org/downloads/_

1. We will have to start and run our Server first. To do that open your PCâ€™s terminal and enter the following command: `python Server.py` 
3. Now, open another terminal window (the number of terminal windows should be open according to the number of clients you want to have chatting with) to run the Client file and to start chatting. Run command `python Client.py`
